        "My refinements on the spot are clear evidence of the design that is iterative and increasing control over the collaboration with the AI. The Week 3 - Planning Before Coding approach was the first prompt to clarify the inputs, outputs, and a plan with steps that should be observed in detail. Nevertheless, the resulting pseudocode was implicit and it did not have a strong structural framework. In Prompt 2, I used the Week 4 Function Design Principles so that the concerns could be divided into discrete, testable modules to make them simpler and easier to maintain. I then combined the Week 6 Defensive Programming strategy which included the validation of empty input and index range cheques to overcome runtime mistakes. These amendments also made it easier to read later on doctesting as explained in the Week 9 Testing Introduction. In the process, I used human judgement combined with AI suggestions and repackaged outputs that went beyond the scope that was set by Week 10. This provided the total adherence to the course curriculum and at the same time showed the evolution of a basic plan into a logically laid out, user-friendly design by component iterative prompting which can simulate the professional problem-solving processes that are being taught in our laboratories."
